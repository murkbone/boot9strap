Here's how to use boot9strap (if you're a new user):

1. Put your desired game (available list in options) into the boot9strap folder
2. Change your replace.txt file (in the files folder) with your desired hax
(IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING / HAVE NO HAX, DON'T CHANGE THIS!!!!)
3. Open up boot9strap
4. Configure your game in options (other games coming soon)
5. Run "Bootstrap NTRBoot"
6. Let boot9strap run (if it doesn't, you will be transported to a fail screen)
7. Remove Auxilium from the folder
8. Enjoy your new hax
